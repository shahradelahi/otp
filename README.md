_@se-oss/otp_ is a simple and lightweight library for generating and verifying one-time passwords (OTP) that are compatible with Google Authenticator. It supports both time-based (TOTP) and counter-based (HOTP) OTPs.

## üìñ Usage

### Generating a New OTP Instance

To get started, you can generate a new `OTP` instance. This will create a cryptographically secure secret for you.

```typescript
import { OTP } from '@se-oss/otp';

// Generate a new OTP instance with default options
const otp = OTP.generate();

// You can access the secret to store it for later use
console.log('Generated Secret:', otp.secret);
// e.g., store otp.secret in your database for a user
```

### Loading an Existing Secret

If you have an existing base32 encoded secret, you can create an `OTP` instance with it.

```typescript
import { OTP } from '@se-oss/otp';

const existingSecret = 'GEZDGNBVGY3TQOJQGEZDGNBVGY3TQOJQ'; // User's secret from your database

const otp = new OTP({ secret: existingSecret });
```

### TOTP (Time-Based OTP)

TOTP is the most common type of OTP, used by apps like Google Authenticator.

```typescript
// Assuming 'otp' is an OTP instance from the examples above

// Generate a TOTP code
const code = otp.totp();
console.log('Current TOTP code:', code);

// To verify a code from the user:
const userCode = '123456'; // Code provided by the user
const isValid = otp.totpVerify({ code: userCode });

if (isValid) {
  console.log('‚úÖ Code is valid!');
} else {
  console.log('‚ùå Code is invalid!');
}

// You can also check a wider window of time (e.g., 2 steps back, 2 steps forward)
const isValidWithWindow = otp.totpVerify({ code: userCode, window: 2 });
```

### HOTP (Counter-Based OTP)

HOTP uses a counter instead of time. The counter must be synchronized between the server and the client.

```typescript
// Assuming 'otp' is an OTP instance from the examples above

const counter = 1; // This should be stored and incremented on your server

// Generate an HOTP code
const code = otp.hotp({ counter });
console.log(`HOTP code for counter ${counter}:`, code);

// To verify a code from the user:
const userCode = '755224'; // Code provided by the user for counter 1
const isValid = otp.hotpVerify({ code: userCode, counter });

if (isValid) {
  console.log('‚úÖ Code is valid!');
  // IMPORTANT: Increment the counter for this user for the next verification
} else {
  console.log('‚ùå Code is invalid!');
}
```

## ‚úÖ Todo

- [ ] Generate `otpauth://` URI for QR code scanning
- [ ] Create dedicated `TOTP` and `HOTP` classes
- [ ] Add QR code generation (e.g., as a data URI)
- [ ] Add recovery codes generation
- [ ] Add more detailed documentation and examples
